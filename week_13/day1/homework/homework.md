# Express + Webpack Homework

We've seen _a lot_ today! Tonight's homework is going to practice everything we have seen.

Based on the starter code:

## Server API Tasks
- Create an api for the films app using an /api/films restful route pattern and Express Router
- Index route to show all films
- Get film by id (id is just an array index fo rnow, until we hook up a database)
- Create film
- Update film
- Delete film

Don't forget to get your app to use the controllers/index.js!

Use Insomnia to test your CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE routes

If you are feeling brave, add a new review to a film.

REMEMBER to use `nodemon server.js` so that you're changes are picked up!!!!!

## Webpack Front End Tasks
* Add a genre to a film and render it in the UI on the home page

Remember to run webpack -w using an npm script
