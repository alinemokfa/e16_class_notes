## Canvas Lab
Either:

A: Make an etch-a-sketch using the canvas. Use the arrow buttons to draw the line up/down/left/right. Extend by drawing a container that looks like an old school etch-a-sketch, and/or stopping the line from going out of the bounds of the canvas.

B: Make a simple 'MS Paint' app using the canvas. Let the user choose from different size brushes and colours. Extend by having different image 'stickers' they can pick and place on their drawing. 

Have fun, be creative!
