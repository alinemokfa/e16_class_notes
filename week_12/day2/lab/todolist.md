# To-Do List Lab

The To-Do List app needs to allow a user to create a list of task items. Using the start point, complete the empty functions.

## MVP
The items should be persisted as an array of strings, saved to local storage. On load, the app should first display any data that is already saved in local storage.

When a user enters a new To-Do item, the app should:
- append the new item to the html list
- save the new item to local storage

HINT: Tackle this by first implementing the handleButtonClick function, then addItem, then save and then populate. 

## Extensions
Create a drop-down of many to-do lists that are stored in localStorage
HINT: you'll have to use a different data structure (an array of objects maybe?)
