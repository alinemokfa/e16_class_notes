## Map Homework 

### Learning objectives:

- practice adding event listeners to items in the DOM
- practice using the Google Maps API
- use documentation and online research to add features to your map

### Tasks

- Add an Info Window to one of the markers on your map (see the Google Maps API documentation) with some information about the place it's marking. 

- Add a button below the map that says 'Take me to Chicago' (or another city) which moves the center of the map to be the co-ordinates of that city. Tip: look up the 'setCenter' method for Google Maps.

Extension:

Add a button below the map with the text 'Where Am I?'. When the user clicks the button, use geolocation to set the center of the map to their current location.

Try implementing any extra map functionality of your choice, e.g. changing the styling of the map, adding shapes to it, using custom images for markers.
