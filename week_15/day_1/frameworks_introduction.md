# Introduction to Frameworks

## Why are we doing this?

When we were building our JavaScript projects in VanillaJS it felt like we were cobbling together our programs almost like putting Lego bricks together. We often end up with a bit of a Frankenstein.

Frameworks on the front and back end provide us with a structure and often handle common tasks for us. Frameworks usually make building something quicker or easier. However, we have to learn how to speak in the language of the framework we choose to use. 

Each framework has it's own way of doing things. Some are more opinionated than others.

Once we've learned how to talk in a framework's language we can leverage the code that a framework gives us. It means we don't have to worry about doing tasks like event handling, dealing with the DOM or creating a our RESTful routes by hand.

It means we can focus on the core of our application and the logic we need to write.

## Existing Codebase

When you go into a new job, it's likely that you will initially be working with an existing codebase - it might be in VanillaJS or it might be written in a framework.

You've already done the hard work to learn VanillaJS and Ruby which is a great foundation for your career as a developer. But it's also important to know how to go about fixing a bug or adding a feature to an existing application.

We'll have a quick look at a few other front end frameworks to get a taste of doing this.

## What will we learn?

We've chosen 2 frameworks - a front end and back end framework - to get experience building something with these powerful tools. 

 - React
 - Rails
 - Using an ORM
 - JS Frontend Tooling
 - Working on an unfamiliar codebase
 - Some ES6 (ES2015)
 - Authentication
 - Modern Web Architecture

However, it's important not to become a stubborn disciple of one particular framework. All have different philosophies and strengths and weaknesses.

# Modern Web Architecture

Ultimately we're aiming to build a a front end application (in React) that will be served from one server. And an API (in Rails) which we will serve from another server.

Our front end and back end API will not be tightly coupled. That means we could build a front end as a mobile app or HTML and use the same API.

# Common Frameworks

## Front end
 - React 
 - Angular
 - Ember
 - Backbone
 - Knockout

## Back end
 - Rails
 - Django
 - Sinatra - (lightweight and unopinionated)
 - Express - (lightweight and unopinionated)
 - Sails 

## Full stack
 - Meteor
 - MEAN

## Let's play Framework or Library!

 1. jQuery (l)
 2. Lodash (l)
 3. React (f/l?)
 4. Angular (f)
 5. Meteor (f)
 6. Rails (f)
 7. Mocha (l)
 8. npm (huh? - invalid answer)
 9. nodeJS (huh? - invalid answer)

It can be a grey area sometimes. Often people will use the terms interchangeably.

The core of great engineering is taking something that has already been built, tested and documented andbuilding something even better. We use existing well tested and documented code and we combine it withour own code to add value.

The team who work on React - that's their fulltime job. It would take us AGES to write our own version of React. So let's leverage what already exists to make our work go even further.

The problem of JS organisation has already been solved, albeit in many different flavours. We don't want to have to reinvent the wheel. We want to spend our time solving other problems that haven't been solved yet and that we can own (or your boss can!).
