# Ruby Testing

## Objectives

- Know what a test is
- Understand Arrange, Act, Assert
- Understand why we test our code
- Be able to use MiniTest to test Ruby functions

## What is a test?

A test is exactly what it sounds like - something that verifies your code is working.
Let's say you write a function:

```ruby
def five()
  return 5
end
```

How do we know that this function is working properly? Sure, we can look at it,
and see that it's working, but that only works while the logic is simple.
Another thing we can do is actually run the code. Like this:

```ruby
puts(five()) # 5
```

Now, whenever we want, we can run the code, and check that the correct thing is
printed out. This is great.

But could we do better? This is software development, after all. Wouldn't it be
ideal if we could write code that ran our code and checked it worked properly?
That would be mind-blowingly cool. And that's exactly what we mean when we talk
about testing our code.

By the end of this lesson we'll be able to write code that automatically verifies
that our functions are working correctly.

## Why should we test?

When we write our code we want to make sure it works as we expected. Maybe this
sounds obvious. So let's make an ever bigger claim. We can craft better code if it's tested.

We haven't really touched on the craft of writing code yet. When we talk about
code craft we mean things like the ability to easily make changes to code without
worrying about introducing bugs, as well as the ability for other people to work
on our code easily.

Having tests we can run ensures that if we break code by changing it we know instantly.
Therefore the quality of the code is instantly improved, even if the code itself is
unchanged. It also means that someone new to our code can look at the tests to very
quickly work out how the code works.

There are many approaches to testing our code but the principles are the same.
What we want to do is write code which expects some specific thing to happen.
These "expectations" are referred to as assertions. As our tests run, each assertion
will either pass or fail, and the result will be printed to the terminal.

Most programming languages have test suites and different ways of testing.
The testing library we will use in Ruby is called MiniTest.

## How do we test?

To setup our tests we create a separate file:

```bash
# terminal
touch my_functions_spec.rb
```

This `my_functions_spec.rb` is going to be run by us manually to ensure our
code works as expected!

We can install additional classes not available by default using the `gem` command
line tool.  It can go to the internet and grab other Ruby classes written by other
people. This is incredibly powerful as it means we don't have to, e.g., write our
own testing framework. Let's grab MiniTest now.

```bash
gem install minitest
```

Now we need to update our Ruby environment so Ruby will pick up that we've installed
these new classes. We can do this by restarting the terminal, or with this command:

```bash
rbenv rehash
```

First we need to require in the gem we installed, as well as the file we are going to test.

```ruby
# my_functions_spec.rb

require( 'minitest/autorun' )
require_relative( 'my_functions' )
```

Then we do some test setup.

```ruby
# my_functions_spec.rb

class FunctionsTest < MiniTest::Test

end
```

This makes a class called `FunctionsTest` that is based on (includes all the functionality of)
the `Test` class in the MiniTest library we just installed.  We'll find out more about
classes in the coming weeks.

Next we write our actual test. We write this in a very similar way to writing a
function with `def`. In MiniTest, all test names MUST begin with the word `test`
for them to be recognised as tests and run.

```ruby
# my_functions_spec.rb

class FunctionsTest < MiniTest::Test

  def test_greet

  end

end
```

## Arrange, Act, Assert

A very common way to structure a test is using "Arrange, Act, Assert", where every
test you write is composed from the following 3 parts:

 * **Arrange** - do any set up necessary for the test (for really simple tests,
    there won't be any)
 * **Act** - call the _function under test_ (one call, never more)
 * **Assert** - check that the right thing happened, using at least one "assert" method

MiniTest gives us a function, `assert_equal` which takes two arguments: the value
you expected to see, and the value you actually got.

We can write a test for the `greet` function we wrote earlier:

```ruby
# my_functions_spec.rb

def test_greet
  # arrange
  # nothing to do here...

  #Â act
  # we're testing the greet method, so we'd better call that
  # store the result so we can check it was right in the next step
  result = greet('David', 'morning')

  # assert
  # given the parameters we passed in, we should expect the function
  # to return 'Good morning, David'
  assert_equal('Good morning, David', result)
end
```

Note that we didn't have any arranging to do - when we have more complex code using
classes later, there will more likely be stuff in this section.

We can run our test file in the terminal:

```bash
# terminal
ruby my_functions_spec.rb
```

We can see there has been one test run, with one assertion, and no failures.

```ruby
# my_functions_spec.rb

def test_add
  result = add(2, 3)
  assert_equal(5, result)
end
```

### Good/bad method names

It's always useful to use function names that say what the function does - use
snake case, and if we are testing the same function multiple times we can use
two dashes then specify the context for that test.

```ruby
# my_functions_spec.rb

def test_add__negative
  result = add(4, -2)
  assert_equal(2, result)
end
```
