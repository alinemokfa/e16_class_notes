# Pair programming

Super-simple explanation:
  - two engineers working together to write one piece of code

More complicated explanation:
  - one laptop
  - one "driving" and one "navigating"
    - driver writes code
    - navigator reviews code, makes suggestions and focuses on overall direction
  - continuous review of code
  - discussion! ("programming out loud")
    - driver explains code while writing it
    - navigator suggests changes/improvements and advises where to go next
    - both stop the other from writing code before tests...
  - knowledge sharing!

What it's not:
  - one engineer writing code while the other watches
  - two engineers writing code on separate laptops
  - silence
  - two engineers sharing a keyboard (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msX4oAXpvUE)
