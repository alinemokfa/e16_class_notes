## Intro to Slack

### Suggested topics to cover

* Make sure they actually have Slack installed and know to keep it running at all times with notifications on

* Adding channels - could suggest that students add channels for future languages but then mute them until they need to use them

* Show `@person` and `@here`

* Reminders - *(...) Remind me about this*

* Talk to slackbot - hit `/` to show functionality

* Show how to add reactions

* Strongly encourage students fill in their profile and add a photo  - *CodeClan (TL) -> Profile & account*

* Talk to yourself - good way of handling ToDos etc

* Show off backticks for `inline` code 

```
and three for blocks
```

* Message history - make the point that messages will disappear

* Show `:keith_it_up` `/giphy` etc :)
