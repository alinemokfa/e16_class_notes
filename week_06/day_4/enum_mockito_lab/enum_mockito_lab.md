### Card Game Lab 

This lab is to model a basic card game and implement the rules.

We aren't looking for a running game, just good TDD to demonstrate that the game works as it should.

####  Highest Card
Build a simple card game that deals one card to every player and the player with the highest card wins. 

#### Extension
Extend Part A to now deal 2 cards to every player and the player with the highest combination of cards wins.
