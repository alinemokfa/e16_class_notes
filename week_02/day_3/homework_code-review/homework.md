# Homework

1. Look at the snakes and ladders sample solution. 
2. Find out how to run the game (it should print out results to the terminal).
3. Try to draw a class diagram of this solution.
4. Think about the following questions and bring your answers for tomorrow's homework review.

### Questions to consider: 

- What is different from the way you tried to solve the problem?
- Are there any parts you don't understand?
- Testing - why has the dice class not been tested?
- Why is all of the 'puts'-ing in one viewer class?
