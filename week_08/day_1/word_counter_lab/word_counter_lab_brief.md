# Lab/Homework - Word Counter

Create a simple Android app can count the number of words in a block of text.

The user will enter a block of text and then, by clicking a button, will see how many words are in the text they entered.

##### You will need:

* An EditText view for entering text
* A button to get the word count
* A (tested) Java class for calculating the word count.

Feel free to practice styling etc.

### Extension:

List the number occurrences of each word . e.g. for the text: 

"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, â€¦"

 You should get something like:

"it" : 6, "was" : 6, "the" : 6, "best" : 1, "of" : 6, "times" : 2, "worst" : 1, "age" : 2, "wisdom" : 1, "foolishness" : 1,  "epoch" : 2, "belief" : 1, "incredulity" : 1

(Hint - you might want to use a HashMap for this)

***IF YOU ARE REALLY BRAVE*** - order the occurrences of each word from highest to lowest e.g.:

"it" : 6, "was" : 6, "the" : 6, "of" : 6, "times" : 2, "age" : 2, "epoch" : 2, "best" : 1, "worst" : 1, "wisdom" : 1, "foolishness" : 1, "belief" : 1, "incredulity" : 1
