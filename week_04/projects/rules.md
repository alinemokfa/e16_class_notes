# Project Rules

You are required to submit your link to github as soon as it has been created. 

Students will have a 10-15 minute one-to-one twice during the project:
 - Monday afternoon as a short review of how things are going
 - Thursday afternoon - check in to see how things have gone, and for a review of the code.
(Note - these sessions are not for getting help at fixing problems)

You are still expected to come in to CodeClan each day during project week. Stand-ups will take place at 9am every day but will be a bit different. Rather than everyone attending the same stand-up, there will be smaller 'mini' stand-ups made up of people working on the same project brief. At least one instructor will attend each group's stand-up.

Presentations will be held on Friday.

The project must be built using only:
  - Sinatra
  - PostGRES SQL
  - HTML / CSS
  - Ruby

It must NOT use any technology that has not been taught as part of the CodeClan curriculum.

The instructional team will be on hand to help but we would strongly encourage you to:
- Try and solve the problem yourself by reading the error message
- Google specific terms to see if you can find the answer
- Ask your peers on the same project as you for advice

Failing this, we will come to your aid and don't spend more than 30 mins stuck on a problem without asking someone for help.

We want to see lots of meaningful Git commits and the use of TDD where / if appropriate.
