# Algorithms Homework

## Basic

Choose one of the following algorithms:

* Bubble sort
* Cocktail-Shaker sort
* Quick sort
* Odd-even sort
* Merge sort
* Insertion sort
* Bucket sort
* Interpolation search
* Jump search
* Fibonacci search

Spend some time researching your chosen algorithm. Write a short (2-5 minute)
presentation about the algorithm, how it works, and what it's used for. You
may also want to consider any obvious downsides to the algorithm, or compare it
to another search or sort algorithm (either another one on the list, or one we've
seen in class).

Please don't just read out the Wikipedia pages for these. We've seen them already.
Where do you think we got the list?

You'll be giving your presentation to the class on Thursday.

## Extension

Implement your chosen algorithm in either Ruby or Java, with suitable test cases.
