# Inheritance Mini-Lab

Make your own mini chain of inheritance: 

* Make a Person class.  A person should have a first name and last name and a talk method which says its name.
* Make a Medic class which inherits from Person, and also has a heal method.
* Make an Agent class that also inherits from Person, but talks like an agent:  "The names Bond, James Bond".
