# Intro

Here at CodeClan we have a collaborative form of learning. We are all trying to work together. The aim is not just that you learn from the instructor, but from the others in your class.

Feel free to ask any questions you have. There is no such thing as a 'stupid' question. It may be that someone else has got the same question as yourself.

If we cannot answer your question straight away, then we'll put it on a post-it note and stick it on our 'Car Park' board, and will try to provide an answer either later that day, or overnight.

We have also created a channel on Slack, to which you have all been invited. Please join this channel as we will be using it to share code. It's also a great place to put any questions you have? If you see a question on Slack from someone, feel free to answer that question.

If any of you still have unresolved questions, or just want to chat about something then I'll be here from 9:15 each morning.
