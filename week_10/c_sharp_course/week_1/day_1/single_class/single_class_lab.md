# Classes Lab / Homework

In this lab, we'd like you to make a class of your own. Below we've outlined a scenarios to be modelled as Classes. Throughout each part stick to using our Test Driven Development process of writing our tests first then writing our methods and refactoring until they pass.

## Learning Objectives

1. Create your own class
2. Create multiple objects
3. Add some properties
4. Use getters and setters
5. Add some methods and behaviours
6. Get methods and behaviours to interact with properties

We would like you to make a class that represents a sports team.

* Make a class to represent a Team that has the properties Team name (String), and a Coach (String).
* For each instance variable in the class make a getter method that can return them.
* Create a setter method to allow the coach's name to be updated.
* Add a points property into your class that starts at 0.
* Create a method that takes in whether the team has won or lost and updates the points property for a win.
