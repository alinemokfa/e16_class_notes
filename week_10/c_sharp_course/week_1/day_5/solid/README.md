# S.O.L.I.D

SOLID is an acronym representing the "first five principles" of object orientation named by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) in the early 2000s.

We don't want our classes having to be modified for changes if we can avoid it. Changes can mean new bugs and breaking previously working code. Ideally, we want to make our code to have options about how it works without altering the source code. Coding to the S.O.L.I.D principles can help us achieve this.

The code folders provide examples of before a refactor to the principle, and after. The code builds on each example, so it's best to read them in the order below.

## Reading Order

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Dependency Inversion
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Open/Closed Principle
