## The OO CodeClan Caraoke (CCC)

You have been approached to build software for a Karaoke bar. Specifically, they want you to build software for checking guests in and out, plus handling songs.

Your program should be test driven and should be able to:

- Create rooms, songs and guests
- Check in guests to rooms/Check out guests from rooms
- Add songs to rooms

### Extensions

- What happens if there are more guests trying to be checked in than there is free space in the room?
- Karaoke venues usually have an entry fee - So the guests could have money so they can pay it.
