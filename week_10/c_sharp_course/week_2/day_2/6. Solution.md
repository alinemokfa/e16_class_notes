# Task Solution

Okay so first we add the method to the interface.

```
    public Branch GetById(int id)
    {
        BankEntities bankCtx = new BankEntities();

        var foundBranch = (from branch in bankCtx.Branches
                           where branch.BranchId == id
                           select branch).FirstOrDefault();

        return foundBranch;
    }
```

Finally back in controller.

```
    return BranchRepository.GetById(id);
```

And lets run and try to find our ID.

Great, okay, so lets just do a quick check. Lets say we want to follow best practice. If it is not found. We will return a 404.

```
    var branch =  BranchRepository.GetById(id);

    if(branch == null) {
        Response.StatusCode = 404;
    }

    return branch;
```

There are various ways you can do this, you can also throw a HttpException and set the status code that way.
