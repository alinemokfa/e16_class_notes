Create a new Accounts API  

Standard CRUD operations apply.

C - Create an account through POST request
R - Get by id and get all accounts
U - Update a account by id
D - Delete account by id.

Don't forget

    * IAccountRepository and AccountRepository to handle operations
    * Startup.cs services.addScoped so that our server knows that when we request our new interface they will load.
