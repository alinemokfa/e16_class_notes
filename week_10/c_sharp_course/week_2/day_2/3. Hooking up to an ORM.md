# ORM to our API.

## Setting up

Lets create a new folder called models.

```
 New folder
 Models
```

Also bring in the packages. 

```
    Go to project
    Select add packages
    Search for Microsoft.EntityFramework core and install it.
    Accept the licences.
    Search for NPGSQL.EntityFramework core postgresql provider and install it.
```

Now lets create a Branch.cs file like we did yesterday.

In models folder, we create a Branch.cs file.

```
    public class Branch
    {
        [Key]
        public int BranchId { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(20)]
        public string BranchName { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(6)]
        public string SortCode { get; set; }
    }
```


Lets create a Database folder were we will store our Entities and connection details.

```
    New folder Database
    New file BankEntities
```

And in BankEntities.cs
```
    using System.IO;
    using ExampleApi.Models;
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
```

```
public class BankEntities : DbContext {
    public DbSet<Branch> Branches { get; set; }

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
            .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
            .Build();


        optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(config["connectionString"]);
    }
}
```

In appsettings.json lets add our connection string.

```
    "connectionString": "host=localhost; database=apiexample",
```

So for our next step lets try to generate a migration. First we need to add .Design and modify our csproj since VS for mac has a flaw.

```
<ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet" Version="1.0.0" />
 </ItemGroup>
```

And dont forget to copy our appsettings to output.

```
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

Lets take a quick peek to make sure all good.
Lets run our migrations.

```
    dotnet ef database update
```

Cool, now we are set up with our ORM context, lets set up a new controller.
