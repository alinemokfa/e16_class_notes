# Solution

Okay, so lets create our controller route.

```
    [HttpDelete("{id}")]
    public Branch DeleteById(int id) {
        var branch = BranchRepository.DeleteById(id);
        return branch;
    }
```

In our interface:

```
   Branch DeleteById(int id) 
```

In our class

```
    public Branch DeleteById(int id)
    {
        var branch = GetById(id);

        if(branch == null) {
            return null;
        }

        BankEntities bankCtx = new BankEntities();

        bankCtx.Branches.Remove(branch);
        bankCtx.SaveChanges();

        return branch;
    }
```

So lets run it.

All works. There are few school of talks, some people might say return 404 if branch is not found. Some say you shouldn't return the deleted resource. Its up to your service requiresments to decide this.
