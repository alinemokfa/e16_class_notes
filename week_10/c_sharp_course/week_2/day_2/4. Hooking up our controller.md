# Controllers

Lets create a new file and call it 

## Convention

So when we create a controller file, we say BranchesController.

This is requried as the keyword Controller is used by .NET to determine entry points. Lets also define the route above our class.

```
    [Route("api/branches")]
```

And now lets create one get method that will return a string.

```
    [HttpGet]
    public String getBranches() {
        return "Branches";
    }
```

Lets run it and make sure we get our string back in insomnia. Cool, okay so lets go over some restful routes.

If we call a get to /api/branches, we want to get all our branches. So we could just create a new bankentities and use that, but we want to do it cleanly, to do that we will use dependency injection. We want to rely on abstraction as much as possible, since we cannot call our controller constructor ourselves, we can use dependency injection to build the object on each request.

```
    In database folder create an interface called IBranchRepository
```

It will contain a single method for now which will be getAllBranches which will return an enumerable of Branches object.    

```
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using ExampleApi.Models;

    namespace ExampleApi.Database
    {
        public interface IBranchRepository
        {
            IEnumerable<Branch> GetAllBranches();
        }
    }
```


Now lets create a class that will implement that interface. 

```
    Create a new file in database folder.
    Call it BranchRepository
    Remove constructor
    Implement IBranchRepository and just return null for now
```


```
    using System;
    using ExampleApi.Models;
    using System.Collections.Generic;

    namespace ExampleApi.Database
    {
        public class BranchRepository : IBranchRepository
        {
            public IEnumerable<Branch> GetAllBranches() {
                return null;
            }
        }
    }
```

So we are returning null for now. Lets use our BankEntities now and if you remember from yesterday we will pull our information. 

```
    public IEnumerable<Branch> GetAllBranches()
    {
        BankEntities bankCtx = new BankEntities();

        return bankCtx.Branches.ToList();
    }
```

Okay thats set up. Lets now accept the interface into our controller and assign it to an instance variable.

```
    public IBranchRepository BranchRepository { get; }

    public BranchesController(IBranchRepository branchRepository)
    {
        BranchRepository = branchRepository;
    }
```


Lets run it and see what happens. We get a 500, you get these if an unexpected error occurs. So if we check our output we can see the error.

```
    Unable to resolve service for type 'ExampleApi.Database.IBranchRepository' while attempting to activate 'ExampleApi.Controllers.BranchesController'
```

So it doesn't know what to do with our interface? Lets tell it that everytime a class accepts that Interface, it should load our custom class.

In our startup.cs we will update our configure service method to say that when we request our interface, load this class.

```
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add framework services.
        services.AddMvc();
        services.AddScoped<IBranchRepository, BranchRepository>();
    }
```

Scoped means that for each request, load a new class. There is also Singleton which means the object will be shared for all requests. For entity framework we use scoped.

Lastly lets not just return branches, lets return our list. So we will update our method in our controller.

```
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Branch> getBranches() {
        return BranchRepository.GetAllBranches();
    }
```

Run and see. 

Yay it works. We got back an empty array. Why? Cause we haven't put it into our database yet.

So lets do a post. For posts, we will pass up a body, it will add it to our database and return the element that was created. We will start from controller and work way down the stack.

In our controller. Lets type a new routes

```
    [HttpPost]
    public Branch addBranch([FromBody] Branch branch) {
        return branch;
    }
```

At the moment it isn't doing anything. The reason we want to return the branch is passed in is just so we can see it in insomnia.

We change the request from a GET to a POST.

And for the body, we need to write the JSON to match the object exactly. 

```
    POST localhost:51401/api/branches
    Body:
    {
        "BranchName": "Princes Street",
        "SortCode": "000000"
    }
```

Click send and we get our branch back. 
Since we dont pass up an ID and we are not doing anything with it it will come back as 0.

Lets start writing our logic. 

```
    [HttpPost]
    public Branch addBranch([FromBody] Branch branch) {
        return BranchRepository.Create(branch);
    }
```


In our interface

```
    Branch Create(Branch branch);
```

And in our BranchRepo

```
    public Branch Create(Branch branch)
    {
        BankEntities bankCtx = new BankEntities();

        bankCtx.Branches.Add(branch);

        bankCtx.SaveChanges();

        return branch;
    }
```

Okay lets run again. And post our data again. 

Success, we got an id, each time we send something it will save to database and return the object with the id set.

Okay, so lets try our get all again. Change post back to get.

Still works. Amazing!. Lets fetch by id now. 

So if you remember, get requests have no body, what we will do is specify how to translate from the get query to an integer.

```
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public Branch GetBranchById(int id)
    {
        return null;
    }
```

When we do a get request 

```
    GET localhost:51401/api/branches/1
```

And if we breakpoint we can see the id is set. Amazing.
