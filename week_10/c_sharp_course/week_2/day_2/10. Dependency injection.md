# Cleaning up.

So in our Branch repo, we are using BankEntities which is fine, except its not ever clean. We can actually clean up our logic just a step further. 

Our bankentity can actually be abstracted away using an interface, were the only value we care about is our DBSet property and wrap the save changes method.

Lets create a IBankEntity interface in database folder.

```
    public interface IBankEntities
    {
        DbSet<Branch> Branches { get; set; }

        int SaveChanges();
    }
```

Back in our BankRepository class file, lets say that in the constructor we accept that interface. 

```
    public IBankEntities BankCtx { get; }

    public BranchRepository(IBankEntities bankCtx)
    {
        BankCtx = bankCtx;
    }
```

Okay, now go through that file and replay all of bankCtx with BankCtx, taking into account we are removing the initialisation logic.

End goal should look like this:

```
    public IBankEntities BankCtx { get; }

    public BranchRepository(IBankEntities bankCtx)
    {
        BankCtx = bankCtx;
    }

    public Branch Create(Branch branch)
    {
        BankCtx.Branches.Add(branch);

        BankCtx.SaveChanges();

        return branch;
    }

    public Branch DeleteById(int id)
    {
        var branch = GetById(id);

        if(branch == null) {
            return null;
        }

        BankCtx.Branches.Remove(branch);
        BankCtx.SaveChanges();

        return branch;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Branch> GetAllBranches()
    {
        return BankCtx.Branches.ToList();
    }

    public Branch GetById(int id)
    {
        var foundBranch = (from branch in BankCtx.Branches
                           where branch.BranchId == id
                           select branch).FirstOrDefault();

        return foundBranch;
    }

    public Branch Update(int id, Branch branch)
    {
        var foundBranch = GetById(id);

        if (foundBranch == null) {
            return null;
        }

        foundBranch.BranchName = branch.BranchName;
        foundBranch.SortCode = branch.SortCode;

        BankCtx.SaveChanges();

        return foundBranch;
    }
```

Lets update our bankentitie to import our interface

```
    BankEntities : DbContext, IBankEntities
```

Okay, lets rerun our project.

We are getting a 500 error now. Again it does not know how to create IBankEntities. It knows it needs this since we said it uses IBranchesRepository and to set that up we need to set up IBankEntities.

Back to startup.cs

```
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add framework services.
        services.AddMvc();

        services.AddScoped<IBankEntities, BankEntities>();
        services.AddScoped<IBranchRepository, BranchRepository>();
    }
```

Rerun the project.

Still works. Amazing, our code is now nice and clean.
