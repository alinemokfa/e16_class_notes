# Updating

Okay so to update we normally do it through a put request.

A put request has a body but you will normally use the the url as well to pass the ID. 

Note: Add items using post

```
    PUT localhost:51401/api/branches/3
    Body: 
    {
        "BranchName": "Princes Street2",
        "SortCode": "000000"
    }
```

So in our controller.

```
    [HttpPut("{id}")]
    public Branch UpdateBranch(int id, [FromBody] Branch branch) {
        return BranchRepository.Update(id, branch);
    }
```

In our interface.

```
    Branch Update(id, branch);
```


And in our class

```
    public Branch Update(int id, Branch branch)
    {
        BankEntities bankCtx = new BankEntities();

        var foundBranch = GetById(id);

        if (foundBranch == null) {
            return null;
        }

        foundBranch.BranchName = branch.BranchName;
        foundBranch.SortCode = branch.SortCode;

        bankCtx.SaveChanges();

        return foundBranch;
    }
```

Run this and it should update.
