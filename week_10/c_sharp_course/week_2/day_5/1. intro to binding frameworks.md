# Binding frameworks

## Intro

So originally years ago, you would use JQuery or just the standard browser api to interact with the DOM. This proved to be a bit messy. Binding frameworks allowed us to write code in a modular way so we could have a view and a javascript controller + model so that we could write cleaner code.

We will be using angular for our binding framework.
