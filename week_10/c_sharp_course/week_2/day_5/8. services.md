# Services

So angular has built in services that allow you to perform certain functionality in your application.

So one such service is the location service.

To load a service we say that the controller uses it. It actually does a pattern match against the variable name so make sure you spell it correctly.

```
    app.controller("myController", function($scope, $location) {
```

The location service has a method call absUrl() that we can use. Lets put its return value onto scope so we can expose it to our html.

```
app.controller("myController", function($scope, $location) {
    $scope.firstName = "Bob";
    $scope.lastName = "Doe"

    $scope.locationName = $location.absUrl();

    $scope.fullName = function() {
        return $scope.firstName + " " + $scope.lastName;
    }
});
```

And in our html

```
    <br />
    {{ locationName }}
```

Now refresh and there is our url woop.

There is an object built into js window.location which also shows this. AngularJS prefers you to use its services otherwise you could run into problems if angularjs doens't handle it correctly.

So there is a service we are now going to be using called http, which handles requests and responses. The http service. We used the fetch object but like i said before, angularjs would prefer you use its services over the standard ones.
