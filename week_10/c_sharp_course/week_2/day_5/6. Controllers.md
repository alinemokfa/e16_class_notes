# Controllers

So we can write some nice logic on the fly but its still not dynamic, we want our items to be backed by a controller which is a javascript object. This controller can allow us to store out variables (instead of ng-init).

If you remember from yesterday, we can then just write our fetch query to pull all branches then.

## Creating a controller.

The bare minimum to write a controller is this: 

```
// Write your Javascript code.
    var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

    app.controller("myController", function($scope) {

    });
```

For this purpose we have our module and controller defined in same file but ideallly module is defined in one file and then for each controller you will have a js file (so that its clean).

Note that the dollar sign does not do anything, its just angularjs convention to do that so its easier to distinguish it from local variables.

Now lets update our index.html.

```
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller = "myController">
</div>
```

Okay, now lets add a few variables to scope.

```
    var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

    app.controller("myController", function($scope) {
        $scope.firstName = "Bob";
        $scope.lastName = "Doe"
    });
```

And back to index.html

```
    <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller = "myController">
        {{firstName + " " + lastName}}
    </div>
```

Perfect! Okay but what we can actually do is add some functions to the scope. We can then call these functions from html!!

```
    $scope.fullName = function() {
        return $scope.firstName + " " + $scope.lastName;
    }
```

Back in our html.
```
    {{ fullName(); }}
```
