# Angular Expressions

So, lets go into our index.html file and add an attribute to our div element. 

```
    <div ng-app="">
    </div>
```

For now don't worry about what this means, its just telling angular to load that module for this div (And everything underneath).

We can use expressions to dynamically generate values.

```
<div ng-app="">
    {{ 3 + 7 }}
</div>
```

And when we go to the page it prints out 10. 

We can make this more dynamic which i will show you soon.
