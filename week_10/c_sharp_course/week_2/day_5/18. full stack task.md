Okay, you are full stack now. The task is this:

* Add a new column to the branch table. Call it city.
* City will be required (clean your table if it will cause a conflict)
* City will have Max length of 20.
* Add your migration (dotnet ef migrations add <name>)
* Run migration (dotnet ef database update)
* remember what needs updating in terms of your repository class. So remember that the update functionality will need changing
* Update the front end so that we can create a new branch and city
* The list of branches should show the city and we should be able to change it.
