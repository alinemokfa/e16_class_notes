# $HTTP angular service

Okay, so we know we hard code some variables onto the scope and see it into html. But lets now pull our information from the server and render that. 

Okay, so first things first, lets update our controller to handle our url.

Lets clear our controller and index.

```
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller = "myController">

</div>
```

In our controller we will use http.
```
    app.controller("myController", function($scope, $http) {   
    });
```

First things first we will pull down our branches from our api. We do this through the get method. First lets look at the response.

```
    $http.get("api/branches")
    .then(function(response) {
      console.log(response);
    });
```

Oh look at that, the data is already parsed. Thanks angular!

Okay lets set the branches onto the scope.

```
    $scope.branches = response.data;
```

Noice. Okay what if we just displayed branches.

In index:

```
    {{branches}}
```

Cool, okay we got our branches. Except it doesn't look too pretty. Lets write some html to fix that up.

So instead of just printing it out, lets use our ng-repeat directive that we demoed earlier.

In our index lets write.

```
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Branch Name</b></td>
            <td><b>Sort Code</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr ng-repeat="branch in branches">
            <td>{{branch.branchName}}</td>
            <td>{{branch.sortCode}}</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
```

Lets make it prettier. In our site.css

```
td {
    padding: 15px;
    border:outset;
}

table {
    margin-left: 50px;
}
```

Amazing, we are not pulling back information and dynamically displaying it.
