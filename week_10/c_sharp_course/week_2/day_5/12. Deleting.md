# Deleting

Okay, so first thing we want to do is maybe have a button that will say delete for each item.

```
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller = "myController">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Branch Name</b></td>
            <td><b>Sort Code</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr ng-repeat="branch in branches">
            <td>{{branch.branchName}}</td>
            <td>{{branch.sortCode}}</td>
            <td><button> DELETE </button></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
```

And click it doesnt work, obviously we need to add functionality.

In our controller

```
    $scope.delete = function(branch) {
      console.log(branch);
    }
```

And in our index

```
    <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller = "myController">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Branch Name</b></td>
                <td><b>Sort Code</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr ng-repeat="branch in branches">
                <td>{{branch.branchName}}</td>
                <td>{{branch.sortCode}}</td>
                <td><button ng-click="delete(branch)"> DELETE </button></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
```

When we click now, it logs out, great.


So lets now send a delete request to the server. If you remember, we said that a delete request just sends up the ID?

So using http we say

```
    $http.delete("api/branches/" + branch.branchId)
        .then(function(response) {
            console.log("yay");
        })
        .catch(function(err) {
            console.log(err);
        });
```

Generally when you catch you display a dialog box or something but for now console will work.

Okay now run, sweet it says deleted. But its still there. When we refresh its gone, what can we do about that?

## Binding goes both ways.

Okay, so lets post using insomnia some new branches.

Now, lets say when we get a response, we will find the value we deleted by its index in our array.

```
var index = $scope.branches.findIndex(function(branchItem) {
            return branch.branchId === branchItem.branchId;
        });
```

If we look at the docs, it says it will return -1 if not found.

So lets just do a check first

```
    if(index > -1) {

    }
```

And now we can splice the array, which will delete the items from the array starting at index, and we will say just delete 1.

```
    $scope.branches.splice(index, 1);
```

And when we delete, oh wow, swish.
