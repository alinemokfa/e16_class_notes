# Filters

A filter is a way for format, whether it is a number, date, string or even array. Filters on array would be sorting etc.

Filters are desginated by the | operand.

```
    <br />
    {{ firstName | uppercase }}
```

There are plenty of filters, you can actually define your own which is pretty powerful. So you may see something like

```
{{ myArray | orderBy: myOrderByVale}}
```
