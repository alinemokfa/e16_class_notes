# Modules

So a module is what defines our application. Think of it like a namespace, generally applications only have one but you can have multiple dependent on requirements and reuseability and to depedency inject.

So in our site.js. We are gonna create a module.

```
    var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
```

And thats it. So the first value is the name of our module, the second could be an array of modules that we are dependent on.

NOTE: If we type

```
    var app = angular.module("myApp");
```

What we are actually saying is get me that module, not creating it so be careful as it could trip you up.

Now we have defined a module. All services, controllers and directives can go below that module.
