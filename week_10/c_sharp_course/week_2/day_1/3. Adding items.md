# Create 

So we are going to through our CRUD operations, we will start with Create.

So back in our main method, we are going to new up our BankEntities class.

```
    BankEntities bankCtx = new BankEntities();
```

Next, we want to be able to add a new Branch to our database. So because we are using ORM to do this, we need to create a new Branch object.

So we will write

```
    Branch branch = new Branch()
    {
        BranchName = "Princes Street",
        SortCode = "001122"
    };
```

Cool, we have our new object. So how can we add it to the database? Well we have our database context which has our DbSet of Branch rows. This DbSet is our access to the database.

So we will access that to add an item to our set.

```
    bankCtx.Branches.Add(branch);
```

Now we need to tell our database to persist any changes that have occured. To do this we just tell our bank entity to save any changes.

And last thing we can do is just print out our id of the branch object and see if it has been set. 

```
    Console.WriteLine($"Branch id: #{branch.BranchId}");
```


Our final main method should look like this.

```
    BankEntities bankCtx = new BankEntities();

          Branch branch = new Branch()
          {
              BranchName = "Princes Street",
              SortCode = "001122"
          };

          bankCtx.Branches.Add(branch);
          bankCtx.SaveChanges();

          Console.WriteLine($"Branch id: #{branch.BranchId}");
      }
```

Lets run our code.

Great, we got an Id of 1. If we open up psql.

```
    psql
    \c ormtutorial
    select * from "Branches";
```

We can see our item added. Coolio.

Lets test our max length, if we modify our creation of a branch. 

```
    Branch branch = new Branch()
    {
        BranchName = "Princes Street",
        SortCode = "this exceeds max length"
    };
```

Okay good, it blows up, so our max length prevents inputs. 

Lets set it back to original value.

```
    Branch branch = new Branch()
    {
        BranchName = "Princes Street",
        SortCode = "001122"
    };
```

Run again.

Still works, each time we run, we are creating a new item. Lets look at ways we can retrieve this data.
