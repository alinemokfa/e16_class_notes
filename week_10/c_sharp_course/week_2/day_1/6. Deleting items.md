# Deleting

So we are now onto our last crud operation. Deleting.

To remove an item is even easier in EF. We can first retrieve branch we want by using the find method we created.

```
    Branch branch = findBranchById(bankCtx, 1);
```

Then, we can just tell our Branches DbSet that we want to remove that object.

```
    bankCtx.Branches.Remove(branch);
```

Then we can tell our brank context later to save the changes.

```
    brankCtx.saveChanges();
```


Finally lets print all our details again.

```
    printAllDetails(bankCtx);
```

Okay run now and we will now see that our id of 1 is gone. When we run again it will be null as the id of 1 is gone, this will throw an exception so just be weary of nulls.

Note that there is a remove range function as well. So lets take out our find method, replace it with our findbybranchname

```
    List<Branch> branches = findBranchBySortCodeAndName(bankCtx, "Not Princes Street", "000000");

    bankCtx.Branches.RemoveRange(branches);
    bankCtx.SaveChanges();
```

And all our branches are gone.

We can also delete all branches by saying

```
    var allBranches = (from branch in bankCtx.Branches select branch).ToList();
    bankCtx.Branches.RemoveRange(allBranches);
    bankCtx.SaveChanges();
```

Now we can move onto adding more relationships.
