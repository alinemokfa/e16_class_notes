# LINQ 

So we have found a way to add a new item. But how do we query our database.

First, so we can remember what we typed, lets seperate out our create logic. 

```
    static void Create(BankEntities bankCtx) {
     Branch branch = new Branch()
     {
         BranchName = "Princes Street",
         SortCode = "000000"
     };

     bankCtx.Branches.Add(branch);
     bankCtx.SaveChanges();

     Console.WriteLine($"Branch id: #{branch.BranchId}");
    }
```


Linq stands for language integrated query and it allows us to write queryable code on lists and collections. It can also be used to translate the code using Entity Framework so that we don't have to write direct database queries.

We are gonna be using LINQ to hit our branches table.

## Fetch all items

We are gonna write our linq query to retrieve all items in our database, be weary if you have a lot of items in your database then it will be a lot of objects in memory and could cause memory exceptions.

So we just have to write

```
    BankEntities bankCtx = new BankEntities();
    var allBranches = from branch in bankCtx.Branches select branch;
```

To break it down, it has all the elements of a standard SQL statement just in a different order. 

If we debug what is it actually returning?

### IQueryable

So all linq statements return what is called an IQueryable. Our database has not actually been hit yet. To force us to get the results, we need to do something that requires it to retrieve the information. This can be one of several ways.


### Calling count

If we were to call count on this queryable.

```
    Console.WriteLine($"Count: " + allBranches.Count());
```

We can see that it returns 3, which is correct, it has enumerated the database counted it. So how do we get the actual values?

### ToList

So we have a queryable, we can force it to pull all the information by calling .toList() on our queryable.

```
    var branches = allBranches.ToList();
```

This returns a list of the type we were expecting. We can then enumerate this list and print out the individual details.

```
    foreach(var branch in branches) {
        Console.WriteLine($"ID: {branch.BranchId}, " +
                          $"Branch: {branch.BranchName}, " +
                          $"Sort: {branch.SortCode}");
    }
```

Okay, we printed out everything, great. Lets find out we can filter this list.


## Filtering

So in databases, we can use where clauses to search for items. We can actually do the same with LINQ.

If we remove our count call and move our logic to a printAllDetails method. We can come back to this later. Lets take out the count call also.

```
    static void printAllDetails(BankEntities bankCtx) {
        var allBranches = from branch in bankCtx.Branches select branch;

        var branches = allBranches.ToList();

        foreach (var branch in branches)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"ID: {branch.BranchId}, " +
                              $"Branch: {branch.BranchName}, " +
                              $"Sort: {branch.SortCode}");
        }
    }
```

We can now go back to our main method and write our filter. Lets say we wanted to retrieve a specific item. We would select by id.

```
    var filteredBranch = 
          (from branch in bankCtx.Branches 
           where branch.BranchId == 1 
           select branch);

      Console.WriteLine($"Count: {filteredBranch.Count()}");
```

So here, we should get a count of 1. To grab this item and print out the details we could now write.

```
    Branch foundBranch = filteredBranch.FirstOrDefault();

    if (foundBranch != null) {
        Console.WriteLine($"ID: {foundBranch.BranchId}, " +
                  $"Branch: {foundBranch.BranchName}, " +
                  $"Sort: {foundBranch.SortCode}");
    }
```

So queryable will always be a list, so we need to ask for a FirstOrDefault on it. This method returns the item or the default of that item, which will be null in our case. So if we found that branch, we can display it. Lets seperate our logic just a bit.

```
    static void findBranchById(BankEntities bankCtx, int id) {

        var filteredBranch =
            (from branch in bankCtx.Branches
             where branch.BranchId == id
             select branch);

        Branch foundBranch = filteredBranch.FirstOrDefault();

        if (foundBranch != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"ID: {foundBranch.BranchId}, " +
                      $"Branch: {foundBranch.BranchName}, " +
                      $"Sort: {foundBranch.SortCode}");
        }
    }
```

We will now call this method a few times, and see what gets printed out. So back in our main method we will have

```
    BankEntities bankCtx = new BankEntities();

    findBranchById(bankCtx, 1);
    findBranchById(bankCtx, 2);
    findBranchById(bankCtx, 3);
    findBranchById(bankCtx, 4);
```

Run and see what happens. So it didn't crash, great. Lets just display something if not found.

```
    if (foundBranch != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"ID: {foundBranch.BranchId}, " +
                  $"Branch: {foundBranch.BranchName}, " +
                  $"Sort: {foundBranch.SortCode}");
    } else {
        Console.WriteLine($"ID: {id} Not found");
    }
```

We can also do multiple where conditions. So we will create another method.

```
static void findBranchBySortCodeAndName(BankEntities bankCtx, string name, string sort)
   {
       

   }
```

And add our logic there.

```
    var filteredBranch =
        (from branch in bankCtx.Branches
         where branch.BranchName == name 
            && branch.SortCode == sort
         select branch);

    Branch foundBranch = filteredBranch.FirstOrDefault();

    if (foundBranch != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"ID: {foundBranch.BranchId}, " +
                  $"Branch: {foundBranch.BranchName}, " +
                  $"Sort: {foundBranch.SortCode}");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Not found Bank Name {name} with sort {sort}");
    }
```

We will keep the rest the same as the findbyid method, but you can see that we can use the and operator as well as the or operator to queue up filters.

So back to our main method and we will remove our by id method and call our new method.

```
    findBranchBySortCodeAndName(bankCtx, "Princes Street", "000000");
    findBranchBySortCodeAndName(bankCtx, "Not Found", "000000");
```

Running this will will show our first item but the second will not be found. 
If we were to change our and operator to an OR. 

```
    var filteredBranch =
                    (from branch in bankCtx.Branches
                     where branch.BranchName == name 
                        || branch.SortCode == sort
                     select branch);
```

We will find it as that sort code does exist.
