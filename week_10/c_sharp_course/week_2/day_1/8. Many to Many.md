# Many to Many

Okay, so lets our company is branching out and want to also be a library. So what can we do.


Well lets first create a new context then. 

```
    right click
    add new class
    LibraryEntities.cs
```

Lets import our using from before and extend db context.

```
    using System.IO;
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
```

```
    public class LibraryEntities : DbContext
    {
        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
                .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
                .AddJsonFile("app.json")
                .Build();


            optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(config["connectionString"]);
        }
    }
```

So we are now going to create a many to many relationship. We will have a Book table, a Category table and a BookCategory table as a book can have many categories and a category can belong to many books.

First we will create the book, it will have an id, book name and an author for now.

```
    public class Book
    {
        [Key]
        public int BookId { get; set; }

        [MaxLength(30)]
        [Required]
        public string BookName { get; set; }

        [MaxLength(20)]
        [Required]
        public string Author { get; set; }
    }
```

Our category will have an id and category name.

```
    public class Category
    {
        [Key]
        public int CategoryId { get; set; }

        [MaxLength(20)]
        [Required]
        public string CategoryName { get; set; }
    }
```

And back to our context to add the DbSet so migrations will know.

```
    public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Category> Categories { get; set; }
```

So lets just create our migration for these 2 models. Now that we have multiple contexes we need to specify which context we want to add a migration for.

```
    dotnet ef migrations add AddedCategoryAndBookTable --context LibraryEntities
```

So we have our migration now lets update our db. Again we need to say which context is the one we are applying (since the sets have no relation they can be applied however)

```
    dotnet ef database update --context LibraryEntities
```

So, now that we have that, lets add our join table.

```
    Create BookCategory class
```

Add these properties.
```
    public class BookCategory
    {
        [Key]
        public int BookCategoryId { get; set; }

        public int BookId { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey("BookId")]
        public Book Book { get; set; }

        public int CategoryId { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey("CategoryId")]
        public Category Category { get; set; }
    }
```

Lets add that migration now.

```
    dotnet ef migrations add AddBookCategoryJoinTable --context LibraryEntities
```

```
    dotnet ef database update --context LibraryEntities
```

So back in our main method, lets take out all our stuff.

First we create our LibraryContext.

```
    LibraryEntities libCtx = new LibraryEntities();
```

We will create a new Book and 2 categories (Romance and Horror) and save them. Then we will create a new BookCategory and save it.

```
    LibraryEntities libCtx = new LibraryEntities();

    Book book = new Book()
    {
        Author = "Author Name",
        BookName = "Book name"
    };

    Category category = new Category()
    {
        CategoryName = "Horror"
    };

    Category category2 = new Category()
    {
        CategoryName = "Romance"
    };


    libCtx.Books.Add(book);
    libCtx.Categories.Add(category);
    libCtx.Categories.Add(category2);

    libCtx.SaveChanges();
```

Finally we will new up a book category, add it then save it.

```
    BookCategory bookCat = new BookCategory()
    {
        CategoryId = category.CategoryId,
        BookId = book.BookId
    };

    BookCategory bookCat2 = new BookCategory()
    {
        CategoryId = category2.CategoryId,
        BookId = book.BookId
    };

    libCtx.BookCategories.Add(bookCat);
    libCtx.BookCategories.Add(bookCat2);

    libCtx.SaveChanges();
```

Okay now we run it.

No errors. Cool, lets check our db.

```
    select * from "Categories";
    select * from "Books";
    select * from "BookCategories";
```

So lets comment out all that code and see how we can utilise this. First lets add some properties in the model so we can use them.

In Book.cs
```
    public List<BookCategory> BookCategories { get; set; }
```

And in Category.cs

```
    public List<BookCategory> BookCategories { get; set; }
```


Now, when we query for our book, we just need to say it includes the bookcategories and also the categories on the bookcategories.

```
    var foundBook = (from book in libCtx.Books
                     where book.BookId == 1
                     select book)
                            .Include(x => x.BookCategories)
                            .ThenInclude(sn => sn.Category)
                                 .FirstOrDefault();

    Console.WriteLine($"Category: {foundBook.BookCategories.First().Category.CategoryName}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Size: {foundBook.BookCategories[1].Category.CategoryName}");
```

And there we go, many to many.
