# Updating

Lets remove our method calls in our main method so we just declare our bank entity again.

Okay, so updating is actually quite straightforward. You see EF keeps tracks of all the objects that are returned, if a modify one, it will see that change. When i save the changes, it should persist in the database. 

So lets change one of our methods that we created. Our find branch by id should return the found branch and lets take out the writelines. 

```
    static Branch findBranchById(BankEntities bankCtx, int id) {

        var filteredBranch =
            (from branch in bankCtx.Branches
             where branch.BranchId == id
             select branch);

        Branch foundBranch = filteredBranch.FirstOrDefault();

        return foundBranch;
    }
```


Now in our main method we grab that branch, modify a value and then save changes.

```
    Branch branch = findBranchById(bankCtx, 1);

    if(branch != null) {
        branch.BranchName = "Modified";
    }

    bankCtx.SaveChanges();

    printAllDetails(bankCtx);
```

So we run this, and when it prints all the details from our database, we can see that it has been modified. 

Next lets say we wanted to modify multiple items. Well, we can grab back a list and then modify it. So lets update our findByBranchNameAndSortCode method to return the list.

```
    static List<Branch> findBranchBySortCodeAndName(BankEntities bankCtx, string name, string sort)
    {
        var filteredBranch =
            (from branch in bankCtx.Branches
             where branch.BranchName == name 
                || branch.SortCode == sort
             select branch);

        return filteredBranch.ToList();
    }
```

We may need to import System.Collections.Generic;

Lets clear our main method again and add query it.

```
    var branches = findBranchBySortCodeAndName(bankCtx, "Princes Street", "99999");

    foreach(var branch in branches) {
        branch.BranchName = "Not Princes Street";
    }

    bankCtx.SaveChanges();

    printAllDetails(bankCtx);
```

Great, we now updated any branch that was Princes Street and called it Not princes street.

Now we can move onto deleting.
