# One to Many

So we have a branch. Lets say that we wanted to add our accounts and each account is attached to a branch id.

First we are gonna create a new class file which will be model our table.

```
    Right click add
    new file
    class file
    name it Account.cs
```

We will remove the default constructor, lets add some properties. First we add our key. Don't forget to import.

```
    [Key]
    public int AccountId { get; set; } 
```

Then we will add a name and a balance, lets make this required so they will be non null values.

```
    [MaxLength(20)]
    [Required]
    public string AccountHolderName { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public decimal Balance { get; set; }
```

Finally, lets add our reference.

```
    public int BranchId { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("BranchId")]
    public Branch Branch { get; set; }
```

And so that EF can know that this model exists, we need to add it to our dbContext.

So in BankEntities.cs
```
    public DbSet<Account> Accounts { get; set; }
```

And now we add the migration.

```
    dotnet ef migrations add AccountCreate
```

It will generate our migration cs file, if we look at it we can see it sets up the foreign key.

Lets test this out now.

We will run our migration.

```
    dotnet ef database update
```


## Reverting

So lets say we don't want this migration, we can actually tell entity framework to update to a specific migration. It will then know the current state and rollback if needed to the selected migration. So to undo our last one, we just say to go back to an earlier migration.

```
    dotnet ef database update InitialCreate
```

You can see from the logs it removed our migration from history as well as dropped the Account table.

So lets re apply our migration.

```
    dotnet ef database update
```


## Pulling back relational information.

So we can do all the snazzy stuff that we could do with branches, we can create, delete, update and select.

Lets create a simple Account, but first, we need it to have a BranchId...why? because we specified a foriegn key.


So in our Create method, lets return the branch so we can use that id.

```
   static Branch Create(BankEntities bankCtx) {
        Branch branch = new Branch()
        {
            BranchName = "Princes Street",
            SortCode = "000000"
        };

        bankCtx.Branches.Add(branch);
        bankCtx.SaveChanges();

        return branch;
    }
```

And in our main method. We will get the created branch for now.

```
    var branch = Create(bankCtx);
```

Then we can now create a new Account object and use our newly created branch.

```
    var account = new Account
    {
        BranchId = branch.BranchId,
        Balance = 2.0M,
        AccountHolderName = "Darren"
    };
```

Then we add it to our account.

```
    bankCtx.Accounts.Add(account);
```

Then finally save our changes

```
    bankCtx.SaveChanges();
```

Run the project.

So it ran okay, lets go into psql.

```
    psql
    \c ormtutorial
    select * from "Accounts";
```

And its there. Cool

So lets look at how we can use that information from accounts.

Lets create a method that will return our account by id. But we need to alter it to say that we need it to include the Branch, this will peform an inner join under the hood and pull all the relevant details into our Branch Property.

```
    static Account findAccountById(BankEntities bankCtx, int id) {
        var filteredBranch =
           (from account in bankCtx.Accounts
            where account.AccountId == id
            select account).Include(x => x.Branch);

        Account foundAccount = filteredBranch.FirstOrDefault();

        return foundAccount;
    }
```

Don't forget to include that namespace
```
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

And now we will call it with the id of our newly created account.

```
    Account account = findAccountById(bankCtx, 1);
```

Since we know account has a branch property, lets see if we can just access its properties.

```
    Console.WriteLine($"Account: {account.AccountHolderName} " +
                      $"has branch {account.Branch.BranchName}");
```

And we do, great!

It should be noted that modifying the branchName on the account.branch property and telling the context to savechanges will persist to the database so be careful.

### Trying to get the accounts from a branch.

Okay so we can get our accounts and for each account we can see what the branch is. Great. What if we wanted to look at a branch and see what the accounts associated with that branch are.

Well in our Branch.cs we will add

```
    public List<Account> Accounts { get; set; }
```

Now, in our main method we are going to update our findbyid method and include our accounts.

```
    var filteredBranch =
            (from branch in bankCtx.Branches
             where branch.BranchId == id
             select branch)
             .Include( x => x.Accounts );
```

Now back in our main method we will say.

```
    Console.WriteLine($"{branch.Accounts.FirstOrDefault().AccountHolderName}");
```

We run the project and we get the first account name. Awesome.

Lets create a many to many relationship.
