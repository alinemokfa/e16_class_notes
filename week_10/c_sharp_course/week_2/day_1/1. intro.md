# Intoduction to object relational mapping

Object relational mapping (ORM) is when you can manipulate objects which can be inserted, updated or retrieved from the database without knowing any database languages (such as PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MYSQL etc).

It can greatly simplify how you pefrom your CRUD operations. 

[!] Ask do they know what CRUD is. 
```
Most operations on a website can take the form of form types.

C - Create (Inserting)
R - Read (Selecting)
U - Update 
D - Deletion
```

ORM's can also make relationships a lot easier in terms of how your code is constructed. You can easily model a 1-1 or 1-many relationship.

Today, we are going to be using one of the most populater mappers that there is which is Entity Framework. Since we working on Macs, we will be looking at Entity Framework core but the logic is the same. We will be first looking at constructing objects that map to our database. Then we will look at performing all the various CRUD operations.
