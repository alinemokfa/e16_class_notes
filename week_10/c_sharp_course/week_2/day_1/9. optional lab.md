# Lab - ORM

For this lab, you will implement a simple ORM console application. You will model a Many to Many relationship. You will have 3 models:

Doctor
Patient
DoctorPatient

Doctor will have just an ID and name (and a list of doctorpatient)
Patient will have an ID and name (and a list of doctorpatient)
DoctorPatient will be our join table.

Try to add a few items to all the tables and pull them back. You should have methods that:

findDoctorById
findPatientById

These methods should return the Model alongisde all associated data.

And using these models, you should be able to update properties or delete the model.
