# Cors

## Hitting our API. 

Okay, so lets hit our api. Change the request to our api.

```
    fetch("http://localhost:51401/api/branches")
    .then(function(resp) {
      return resp.json();
    })
    .then(function(json) {
      console.log(json);
      console.log(json[0]);
    })
    .catch(function(err) {
      console.log(err);
    });
```

And lets click it.

Oh no, whats this.

# Cors

Okay, so this might be good to know, so we can hit our API using insomnia, but when we use the browser api to fetch, it will not allow us to leave our domain for security reasons. This is to stop people modifiying javascript and doing nasty things.

To get arround that, you can tell your server to allow requests from other origins. So lets open up our project from yesterday. And in startup.cs

```
    app.UseCors((builder) => {
        builder.AllowAnyOrigin();
    });
```

Now when we run our project and click the button. Now we might not want to accept any origin for every http method but for this purpose of demoing requests we will be okay. 

Its all good!
