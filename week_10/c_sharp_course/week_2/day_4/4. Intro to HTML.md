# Intro to HTML

## What is HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to structure web pages. There is no intellegence in HTML, its just a markup language (like XML, JSON etc).

### Lets create a simple webpage.

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```

The root node for html is <html>. After that you got the head, it is in here tht you store meta information about the web page, such as external styling, javascript, meta tags for search engines etc.

In our head we have a title, this is what displays in the tab on our web browser. 

Finally we have the body, this is where all the stucture of the page is.

We will be learning more about the structure in due course.
