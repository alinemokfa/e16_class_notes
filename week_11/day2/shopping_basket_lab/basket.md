# Shopping Basket Lab
We need to find the total cost of the items contained in a shopping basket.

- Items should have a name, price and boolean value that determines whether or not they are eligible for a buy one get one free discount.  
- A shopping basket can have multiple items.  
- It should be able to add and remove items.

Discounts:

- 10% discount for all shopping baskets over Â£20
- If the customer has a valid discount card then they get an additional 5% off.

Extension (hard!)
  Add the ability to have buy one get one free items.
